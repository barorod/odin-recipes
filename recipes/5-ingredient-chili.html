    <h2>Easy 5-Ingredient Chili</h2>
    <p>Canned beans and tomato sauce contain varying amounts of salt, and the dish will taste more salty as it continues to simmer.</p>
    <p>Tasting and adding salt to the chili after it is finished will allow you to add just the right amount.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>

        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans, not drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
